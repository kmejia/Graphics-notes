the deal
start as the baseline for mdl and animation
-adding to that
	scanline conversion, lighting and shading
	removal of surfaces behind other surfaces
	(other) mdl features....spec
	mesh
	tweening
	
Scanline conversion
[filling in polysongs by repeatedly draswing lines across the surface]
delta0: always bottom to top
Xt-Xb /(Yt -Yb)

delta1: bottom to middle point or middle to top
switch the two if we each point m
if Y>Ym
 (Xm-Xb)/(Ym -Yb)
this will make sure that you don't divide by zero
