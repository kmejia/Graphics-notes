Modeling Real World Lighting

color is a combination of light(generally white) plus what gets reflected from the object(everything else gets absorbed)
1 . reflective properties of the object
2 . color and intensity of the light

Lighrting equation
-goal is to calculate a color value[0-255] for each polygon (or pixel)
-to generate grayscale images you need to compute the color once per polygon
-to generate a color image, you need to compute seperate red, green,  and
    blue values for each polygon

I(illumination)
Ir
Ig


I = I(ambient) + I(diffuse) + I(specular)
differnet life sources and types of reflection

2 types of lighty sources
  1-ambient light
  	    background lighting, hits everything equally
  2-point light sources	    
  	  light from a particlar locations with a particular direction
	  Reflections are based on the relative location of the surface with
	  	      respect to light
I ambient
  combination of the color of ambient light and the amount of ambient reflection
  	      for the surface
I diffuse
  R eflection of a point source where the light is reflected early in all
  	      directions
