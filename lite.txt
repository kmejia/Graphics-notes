Modeling Real World Lighting

color is a combination of light(generally white) plus what gets reflected from the object(everything else gets absorbed)
1 . reflective properties of the object
2 . color and intensity of the light

Lighrting equation
-goal is to calculate a color value[0-255] for each polygon (or pixel)
-to generate grayscale images you need to compute the color once per polygon
-to generate a color image, you need to compute seperate red, green,  and
    blue values for each polygon

I = I(ambient) + I(diffuse) + I(specular)
differnet life sources and types of reflection

2 types of lighty sources
  1-ambient light
  	    background lighting, hits everything equally
  2-point light sources	    
  	  light from a particlar locations with a particular direction
	  Reflections are based on the relative location of the surface with
	  	      respect to light
I ambient
  combination of the color of ambient light and the amount of ambient reflection
  	      for the surface
I diffuse
  R eflection of a point source where the light is reflected early in all
  	      directions

I = I(ambient) + I(diffuse) + I(specular)
I ambient
  combination of the color of ambient light and the amount of ambient reflection
  	      for the surface
I diffuse
  Reflection of a point source where the light is reflected early in all
  	      directions
	      light comes from a specifi point
	      reflected equally in all directions

I Specular
  light comes from a specific point
  reflected in a specific direction
	      
quality of light
        ambient
		represented by a color value(0-255)
	point light sources
	      represented by a color value and the location of the light

Reflective properties
	   represented as as % of the light that is reflected back (constants)
	   Ka,Kd , Ks
	   Ka +Kd + Ks = 1.0

Ambient
Ca = ambient color
Ka = constant of ambient reflection;;this is a %
 I(ambient ) = Ca *Ka


Diffuse
	diffuse reflection
		this reflects everwhere
->
L
light itself is neither diffuse or specular

Cp= color of point light source
Kd =  constant of diffuse reflection


relation between theta and the reflection is similar to backface culling
I(diffuse) = Cp Kd*cos[theta]

I(diffuse) = 

cos
Use dot product of L and N
we need to turn L and N into unit vectos(normalized)

Specular Reflection
L and R vectors
I(specular) =
