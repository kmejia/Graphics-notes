animation
loop needed, can be used in parser
Relative coordinate system
-currently we use a global coordinate system -each object is drawn with
respect to the same origin/coordinate system
P-> [1003   -> P(x+3)(Y+2)
     0102
     0020
     0001]

-in a relative Coordinate system, each object can have its own coordinate system
-WE will use a stack to store the varopus coordinate systems   
stack(last one in is the first one to pop off

Graphics Framework
A. Transformations are applied to the top of the stack
B. The stack will be pushed and popped as needed
C. Drawing pipeline:
   1 Generate points
   2 multiply points by stack top
   3 Draw the object to the screen
   4 Clear the point matrix
