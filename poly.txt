Wireframe /Polygon Meshes

Wireframe{only has the 8 edges if this was a cube]
-3D objects are defines as the edges that connect the vertices/points
-works well with the existing edge matrix framework
Polygon Surfaces
-3D objects are defined as the surfaces(triangles or quadrilaterals) that
cover the object
-Move from edge matrix to polygon matrix
-allow us to see solid objects
-allow us to remove backfaces
